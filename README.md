# -Bank-Management-System-In-C-
READ ME:

made this code so i could learn imgui, it creates a gui that takes information from the keyboard and populates a linked list with it ,
the information refers to a clients name acc nr and password it takes them all from a textbox checks all the nodes of the linked list,
if it finds them it says the account allready exists and treats it as a login skipping straight to the place where you make withdrawls and deposits
if it doesnt find it it uses a diferent function to create a new node with the curent data and add it before the head this whole thing is handled
by the b_header.cpp and b_header.h files this is all the simple part the hard part came from the using Dear ImGui to create a gui 
banking_main.cpp,banking_interface.h and banking_interface.cpp handle that the rest are imgui library files

Enjoy using this software and modifying it to suit your needs
